The notebook contains analysis and predictions relating to birds striking airplanes. 

Here are some of the aspects explored:

1. Types of aircraft involved
2. Bird species and sizes
3. Time of occurrence
4. Associated costs
5. Predicting costs
6. Predicting damage

This is still an ongoing project.

Planning:
1. Plotting the number of bird strikes over time.
2. Forecasting the number of strikes in the future.
